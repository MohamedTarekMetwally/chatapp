# CHAT APP

This Web App is developed using Ruby on Rails.
The main goal for the app is to send messages between two users or group of users.
I Created groups and it can be named according to the creator or given the privacy of it (private, public). After creating the groups you can send messages There or  Direct message the person you want to contact with.
It's Developed with A simple GUI to interact with, but also you can manage all the features from the Terminal.
unfortunately currently it's working with only the LocalHost and I didn't Develop the Tokens yet, So they are features i am trying to read more about to develop them in the right way.
